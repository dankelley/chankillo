# chankillo

Solar observatory at Chankillo, Peru

# Methods

## Digitizing Site Map

The site map in Figure 2 of @ghezzi_chankillo_2007 was viewed in MacOS Preview,
captured with the MacOS snapshot app, and then the observatory coordinates were
digitized using the imageDigitizer R function
[@kelley_dankelleyimagedigitizer_2020].

To determine scales, it had to be assumed that this diagram was prepared using
natural scaling, because otherwise it would not be possible to infer a scale
for the northing coordinate.

Although the position of the eastern observation location seemed clear on the
diagram, it was not clear exactly where the western one was located.  I elected
to digitize a point on the main diagram that was in the middle of its inset.

The towers that had been built-up on the ridge are indicated with squares in
the original diagram, and rather than try to digitize their corners, I simply
digitized one point at the centre of each.

## Solstice Indicators

@ghezzi_chankillo_2007 indicate that declinations that, in this location and at
the time 300 BCE, the solar declinations at Summer and Winter solstice were
23.75 and -23.75, respectively. These lines are indicated in the diagram, but
the results differ substantially from those in Figures 4 and 5 of
@ghezzi_chankillo_2007, likely indicating an error of the present analysis.
Examination of the sun traces indicated on their diagrams suggests that the
mislocation is not the result of the fact that the present analysis ignores
tower elevation (related to ridge shape). The cause of the mismatch is not yet
known.
